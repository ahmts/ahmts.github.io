      <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Website!</h1>

      <p>Hi there! I'm thrilled to have you visit my GitHub profile site. I'm <strong>Ahmet Efe</strong>, a passionate software developer with a love for open-source projects and collaborative coding. Let me take you on a quick tour of what you'll find here.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I have a diverse background in software development, with work in front-end and back-end technologies. Over the years I've worked on projects ranging from Discord bot projects to desktop programs, web applications to mobile apps. My native languages include C Sharp, C++ and JavaScript, but I'm always willing to learn new technologies and frameworks.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <p>Here are a few highlights of the projects I've been working on:</p>

      <ul>
          <li><strong>Rand</strong>: This Firefox add-on allows users to generate random usernames. Users can choose the length of letter characters and add as many numeric characters as they want. After generating the username, the plugin provides a copy button to facilitate copying.</li>
          <li><strong>TOTPApp</strong>: A WinForm UI wrapper for the Otp.NET package and provides the ability to persistently store 2FA TOTP tokens in a secure manner using AES. <br>(Open-Source Project)</li>
          <li><strong>Smart home Project</strong>: It displays values such as humidity, temperature, room brightness level sent from Esp-32 via bluetooth on your mobile phone. You can even turn on the lamps of the room you want from your phone and prepare a surprise for little thieves.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I cannot publish many more of my projects for privacy reasons.</p>

      <h2>Contributions</h2>

      <p>I'm a firm believer in the power of open source software. Someday I would love to contribute to various open source projects, a rewarding experience that allows me to collaborate with talented developers from around the world.</p>
